"""Definitions of the MethodSource and Processor APIs"""


class MethodSource(object):
    """Base class for MethodSource objects (including Processors and Parsers)
    Most applications will use either Processor or Parser objects, rather
    than directly using a MethodSource object.

    The MethodSource is basically just a generic object whose attributes
    are accessed during generation and/or post-processing of parse results.
    The following are the special attribute forms for use in 

        _m_productionname -- alters the method used in the TextTools
            engine for storing results.  If this is a callable object,
            then call the object with:
                object( taglist,text,l,r,subtags )

            If it is TextTools.AppendToTagobj, then append the result
            tuple to the associated object (_o_productionname).  This
            requires that _o_productionname have an "append" method,
            obviously.

            If it is the constant TextTools.AppendMatch, then append
            the string value which matched the production.

            If it is TextTools.AppendTagobj, then append the associated
            tagobject itself to the results tree.

        _o_productionname -- with AppendToTagobj, AppendTagobj and
            cases where there is no _m_productionname defined, this
            allows you to provide an explicit tagobject for reporting
            in the results tree/getting called with results.
