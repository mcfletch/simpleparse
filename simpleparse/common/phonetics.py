"""Phonetic spellings for character values

At the moment, only contains the "military alphabet"
(Alpha, Bravo ... Yankee, Zulu), which is used as
alternative timezone names by the military and apparently
some aviation groups.  Note, these are fairly common spellings,
but they aren't necessarily going to match a particular
usage.  I may have missed some of the possibilities...

    military_alphabet_char -- fully spelled out versions of
        the Alpha, Bravo ... Yankee, Zulu phonetic alphabet,
        including a few minor variations in spelling such as
        Xray and X-ray.  All characters use title-caps format,
        so Zulu, not zulu will match.
    military_alphabet_char_lower -- as for above, but with
        lowercased versions of the above

No interpreters are provided.  Taking the first character of
the name will always give you the equivalent character uppercase
for the military_alphabet_char and lowercase for the
military_alphabet_char_lower.
