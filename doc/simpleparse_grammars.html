<h1>SimpleParse Grammars</h1>
<p>SimpleParse uses a particular EBNF grammar which reflects the
current
set of features in the system. Though the system is modular enough that
you could replace that grammar, most users will simply want to use the
provided grammar. This document provides a quick reference for the
various features of the grammar with examples of use and descriptions
of their effects.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python 2.x programming</li>
  <li>Some familiarity with EBNF grammars and other parsing terminology</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a basic SimpleParse grammar:</p>
<pre>declaration = r'''# note use of raw string when embedding in python code...<br>file           :=  [ \t\n]*, section+<br>section        :=  '[',identifier!,']'!, ts,'\n', body<br>body           :=  statement*<br>statement      :=  (ts,semicolon_comment)/equality/nullline<br>nullline       :=  ts,'\n'<br>comment        :=  -'\n'*<br>equality       :=  ts, identifier,ts,'=',ts,identified,ts,'\n'<br>identifier     :=  [a-zA-Z], [a-zA-Z0-9_]*<br>identified     :=  string/number/identifier<br>ts             :=  [ \t]*<br>'''</pre>
<p> You can see that the format allows for comments in Python style,
and fairly
free-form treatment of whitespace around the various items (i.e. “s:=x”
and
“s := x” are equivalent). The grammar is actually written such that you
can break productions (rules) across multiple lines if that will make
your
grammar more readable. &nbsp;The grammar also allows both ':=' and
'::=' for the
"defined as" symbol.<br>
</p>
<h2>Element Tokens</h2>
<p>Element tokens are the basic operational unit of the grammar. The
concrete implementation of the various tokens is the module
simpleparse.objectgenerator, their syntax is defined in the module
simpleparse.simpleparsegrammar. You can read a formal definition of the
grammar used to define them at the end of this document.</p>

<h3>Character Classes, Strings and Escape Characters</h3>
<p>Both character classes and strings in simpleparse may use octal
escaping (of 1 to 3 octal digits), hexadecimal escaping (2 digits) or
standard Python character escapes ( \a\b\f\n\r\t\v (Note that “u” and
“U” are missing and that “\n” is interpreted according to the local
machine, and thus may be non-portable, so an explicit declaration using
hexadecimal code might be more suitable in cases where differentiation
is required)). Strings may be either single or double quoted (but not
triple quoted).</p>
<p>To include a "]" character in a character class, make it the first
character of the class. Similarly, a literal "-" character must be
either the first (after the optional "]" character) or the last
character. The grammar definition for a character class is as follows:</p>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 0.2in;">'[', CHARBRACE?,CHARDASH?, (CHARRANGE/CHARNOBRACE)*, CHARDASH?, ']'</pre>
<p> It is a common error to have declared something like [+-*] as a
character range (every character including and between + and *)
intending to specify [-+*] or [+*-] (three distinct characters).
Symptoms
include not matching '-' or matching characters that were not expected.<br>

      <p>Consider a failure to match a SyntaxError (stop parsing, and
raise an exception). If the optional string-literal is included, it
specifies the message (template) to be used for the SyntaxError. You
can use %(varname)s formats to have the following variables substituted:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>position -- the character position at which parsing failed</li>
        <li>line -- the (approximate) line on which parsing failed</li>

        <li>text -- the text from the failure position to 50 characters
beyond the failure position.</li>
      </ul>

    </tr>

</table>
<br>
<p>Using the ErrorOnFail operator can be somewhat tricky.&nbsp; It is
often easier to use the "stand-alone" element-token version of
cut.&nbsp; Here's an example of use:<br>
</p>
<pre>top := a/b/bp<br>a   := 'a', !, ws, '=', ws, something<br>b   := 'b', ws, '=', !, ws, something<br>bp   := 'b', ws, '+=', !, ws, something<br></pre>
<p>The production top can match an 'a =', a 'b =', or a 'b +=', but if
it encounters an 'a' without an '=' following, it will raise a syntax
error.&nbsp; For the two "b" productions, we don't want to raise a
Syntax error if the 'b' is not followed by the '=' or '+=' because the
grammar might match the other production, so we only cut off
back-tracking after the operator is found.&nbsp; Consider this
alternative:<br>
</p>
<pre>top := a/b/bp<br>a   := 'a'!, ws, '=', ws, something # BAD DON'T DO THIS!<br>b   := 'b', ws, '=', !, ws, something<br>bp   := 'b', ws, '+=', !, ws, something</pre>
<p>This grammar does something very different (and somewhat
useless).&nbsp; When the "top" production goes to match, it tries to
match the "a" production, which tries to match the 'a' literal.&nbsp;
If literal isn't there, for instance, for the text 'b =', then the 'a'
literal will raise a SyntaxError.&nbsp; The result is that the "b" and
"bp" productions can <strong>never</strong> match with this grammar.<br>
</p>
<h2>Declarations (Productions) and Result Trees</h2>
<p>Each simpleparsegrammar is a series of declarations which define a
production (rule) and bind it to a name which can be referenced by any
production in the declaration set. Defining a production generally
causes
a result tuple to be created in the results tree (see below for what
else can happen).</p>
<h3>Default Result Tree Generation</h3>
<p>Here are some examples showing sample productions and the result
trees they would generate.</p>
<table cellspacing="8" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> s := "this" </td>
      <td> ('s', start, stop, [] ) # no children </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> s := them, those? </td>
      <td> ('s', start, stop, [ ("them", start, stop, [...]), ("those",
start, stop, [...]) ] )<br>
('s', start, stop, [ ("them", start, stop, [...]) ) # optional value
not there </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> s := them*, those </td>
      <td> ('s', start, stop, [ ("them", start, stop, [...]), ("them",
start, stop, [...]), ("those", start,
stop, [...]) ] )<br>
('s', start, stop, [ ("those", start, stop, [...]) ) # optional
repeating value not present </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>As a general rule, when a production matches, a match tuple is added
to the result tree. The first item of this tuple is normally the
name of the production (as a string), the second is the staring
position of the match, the third is the stopping position of the match,
and the fourth is a list of any child-production's result trees.</p>
<h3>Expanded and Unreported Productions</h3>
<p>Using these features allows you to trim unwanted entries out of your
results tree (which is good for efficiency, as the system doesn't need
to store the result-trees). Using expanded productions can allow
you to reduce the complexity of your grammars by factoring out common
patterns and allowing them to be included in multiple productions
without
generating extraneous result-tuples in the results tree. Both of these
methods still produce standard results trees so no special work is
required to process the results tree. (There are methods described in <a
 href="processing_result_trees.html">Processing Results Trees</a> which
can generate non-standard result trees for special purposes).</p>

      </td>
    </tr>

<h2>Pre-built and Library Element Tokens</h2>
<p>There are situations where the base parsing library simply isn't
capable of accomplishing a particular matching task, or where it would
be much something to define a method for matching a particular class of
value than to define it with an EBNF grammar. In other instances, a
particularly common pattern, such as floating point numbers or strings
with standard (Python) escapes are wanted, and have been provided
in a parsing library.</p>
<p>SimpleParse allows you to pass a set of “pre-built” element tokens
to
the Parser during initialization. These pre-built parsers can either be
instances of simpleparse.objectgenerator.ElementToken, or raw
mx.TextTools tag-tables. To use them, pass the Parser's initializer a
list of two-tuples
of (name, parserObject):</p>
<pre>parser = Parser( declaration, "v", prebuilts = [<br>		("word", parserObject1 ),<br>		("white",  parserObject2 ),<br>	]<br>)</pre>
<p> You can see a working example (which uses Python's re module to
create a prebuilt parser) in examples/prebuilt_call.py .</p>
<p>SimpleParse 2.0 has introduced the ability to create libraries of
common parsers for inclusion in other parsers. At present, the common
package includes numbers, basic strings, the ISO date format, some
character types, and some comment types. New contributions to the
library are welcome. </p>
<p>In general, importing a particular module from the common package
makes the production names from the module available in any subsequent
grammar defined. Refer to the documentation for a particular module to
see what production names are exported.</p>
<pre>from simpleparse.common import strings, comments, numbers</pre>
<p> Many of the standard common parser modules also include
“Interpreter” objects which can be used to process the results tree
generated by the mini-grammar into a Python-friendly form. See the
documentation for the individual modules.</p>
<pre>class MyParser( Parser ):<br>	string = strings.StringInterpreter()</pre>
<h2> Formal SimpleParse 2.0 EBNF Grammar</h2>
<p>This is the formal definition of the SimpleParse 2.0 grammar.
Although the grammar is functional (should parse any proper grammar),
the grammar used during parser generation is a manually generated
version found in the simpleparse.simpleparsegrammar module.</p>
