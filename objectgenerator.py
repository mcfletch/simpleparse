"""Object-oriented tag-table generator objects

The objectgenerator module is the core of the SimpleParse
system, the various element token classes defined here
implement transitions from EBNF-style abstractions into
the low-level (assembly-like) instructions to the
TextTools engine.

Each class within the module is a sub-class of ElementToken,
which provides a number of common facilities, the most
obvious of which is the permute method, which takes care of
the negative, optional, and repeating flags for the normal
case (with character ranges and literals being non-normal).
