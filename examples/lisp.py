"""Basic LISP parser

We use library items, so we get " strings, float, int, and hex
atoms, as well as lists.  Note: Lisp doesn't seem to
use "," for seperating atoms in lists?  I don't really
remember it well enough to recall, but seems to match the
samples I see.

Note: Original grammar was from a sample in the YAPPS
documentation.  Though it's kinda hard to recognise here.
