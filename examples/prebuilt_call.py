"""Example using pre-built "re" parsing object

The Pre-built Element Token lets you include elements
which cannot be readily defined in the SimpleParse EBNF
including items defined by a callout to a Python
function.  This example demonstrates the technique.

The example also (obviously) demonstrates the use of an
re object during the parsing process.
