  <h1>SimpleParse <font size="-2">A Parser Generator for mxTextTools</font>
  </h1>
  <p>SimpleParse is a <a href="#License">BSD-licensed</a> Python package
    providing a simple and fast parser generator using a modified (included) version
    of the <a href="http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools</a>
    text-tagging engine. SimpleParse allows you to generate parsers
    directly from your
    EBNF grammar.</p>
  <p>Unlike most parser generators, SimpleParse generates single-pass
    parsers (there is no distinct tokenization stage), an
    approach taken from the predecessor project (mcf.pars) which
    attempted to create "autonomously parsing regex objects". The resulting
    parsers are not as generalized as those created by,
    for instance, the Earley algorithm, but they do tend to be useful for
    the parsing of computer file formats and the like (as distinct from
    natural language and similar "hard" parsing problems).</p>
  <p>As of version 2.1.0 the SimpleParse project includes a patched copy
    of the mxTextTools tagging library with the non-recursive rewrite of
    the core parsing loop.&nbsp; This means that you will need to build the
    extension module to use SimpleParse, but the effect is to provide a
    uniform parsing platform where all of the features of a give
    SimpleParse version are always available.
  </p>
  <p>SimpleParse is developed <a href="https://github.com/mcfletch/simpleparse">on GitHub</a>
    and you can create pull requests for the project there.
    The author is not working on the project much other
    than as part of maintaining OpenGLContext, so please be patient with
    response times.

    </li>
    <li>Significant optimisations to the generated parse tables, can

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>New in 2.0:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New, refactored and simplified API. Most of the time you only
      need to deal with a single class for all your interactions with the
      parser system (<a href="pydoc/simpleparse.parser.html">simpleparse.parser</a>.Parser),
      and one module if you decide to use the provided post-processing
      mechanism (<a href="pydoc/simpleparse.dispatchprocessor.html">simpleparse.dispatchprocessor</a>).</li>
    <li>"Expanded Productions" -- allow you to define productions whose
      children are reported as if the enclosing production did not exist
      (allows you to use productions for organisational as well as
      reporting purposes)</li>
    <li>Exposure of <a href="processing_result_trees.html#nonstandardresulttrees">callout
        mechanism</a> in mxTextTools</li>
    <li>Exposure of "LookAhead" mechanism in mxTextTools (allows you to
      spell "is followed by", "is not followed by", or "matches x but
      doesn't match y" in SimpleParse EBNF grammars). &nbsp;Specified with
      the prefix ?, as in ?-"this" which matches iff "this" is not the next
      item, but on matching doesn't move the read-head forward (more
      precisely, it causes the engine to continue processing at the previous
      position).</li>
    <li>"Error on fail" error-reporting facility, allows you to raise
      Parser Syntax Errors when particular productions (or element tokens)
      fail to match. &nbsp;Allow for fairly flexible error reporting.
      &nbsp;To specify, just add a '!' character after the element token
      that must match, or include it as a stand-alone token in a sequential
      group to specify that all subsequent items must succeed. &nbsp;You can
      specify an error message format by using a string literal after the !
      character.</li>
    <li>Library of common constructs (<a href="pydoc/simpleparse.common.html">simpleparse.common</a> package)
      which are easily included in your grammars<br>
    </li>
    <li>Hexidecimal escapes for string and character ranges</li>
    <li>Rewritten generators -- the generator interface has been
      seperated from the parser interfaces, this makes it possible to
      write grammars directly using generator objects if desired, and
      allows defining the EBNF grammar using the same tools as generate
      derived parsers</li>
    <li>An XML-Parser (including DTD parsing) based on the XML
      specification's EBNF (this is not a production parser, merely an
      example for parsing a complex file format, and is not yet Unicode
      capable)</li>
    <li>Example VRML97 and LISP parsers<br>
    </li>
    <li>Compatability API for SimpleParse 1.0 applications<br>
    </li>
    <li>With the non-recursive mxTextTools, can process (albeit
      inefficiently) recursion-as-repetition grammars </li>
    <li>Non-recursive rewrite of mxTextTools now ~95% of the speed of the
      recursive version </li>
  </ul>
  <p> General</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple-to-use interface, define an EBNF and start parsing</li>
    <li>Fast for small files -- this is primarily a feature of the
      underlying TextTools engine, rather than a particular feature of the
      parser generator.</li>
    <li>Allows pre-built and external parsing functions, which allows you
      to define Python methods to handle tricky parsing tasks</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>"Class" of Parsers Generated</h3>
  <p>Our (current) parsers are top-down, in that they work from the top
    of the parsing graph (the root production). They are not, however,
    tokenising parsers, so there is no appropriate LL(x) designation as far
    as I can see, and there is an arbitrary lookahead mechanism that could
    theoretically parse the entire rest of the file just to see if a
    particular character matches). &nbsp;I would hazard a guess that they
    are theoretically closest to a deterministic recursive-descent parser.<br>
  </p>
  <p>There are no backtracking facilities, so any ambiguity is handled by
    choosing the first successful match of a grammar (not the longest, as
    in most top-down parsers, mostly because without tokenisation, it would
    be expensive to do checks for each possible match's length). &nbsp;As a
    result of this, the parsers are entirely deterministic.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The time/memory characteristics are such that, in general, the time
    to parse an input text varies with the amount of text to parse. There
    are two major factors, the time to do the actual parsing (which, for
    simple deterministic grammars should be close to linear with the length
    of the text, though a pathalogical grammar might have radically
    different operating characteristics) and the time to build the results
    tree (which depends on the memory architecture of the machine, the
    currently free memory, and the phase of the moon). &nbsp;As a rule,
    SimpleParse parsers will be faster (for suitably limited grammars) than
    anything you can code directly in Python. &nbsp;They will not generally
    outperform grammar-specific parsers written in C.<br>
  </p>
  <h2>Missing Features<br>
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SimpleParse does not current use an Earley or similar highly
      generalised parser, instead, it uses a simple deterministic parsing
      algorithm which, though fast for certain classes of
      problems, is incapable of dealing with ambiguity, backtracking or
      cross-references</li>
    <li>The library of common patterns is extremely sparse</li>
    <li>Unicode support</li>
    <li>There is no analysis and only minimal reduction done on the
      grammar. &nbsp;Having now read most of <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Edick/PTAPG.html">Parsing Techniques - A
        Practical Guide</a>, I can see how some fairly significant changes will
      be required to support such operations (and thereby the more common
      parsing techniques).<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Possible Future Directions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Alternative parsing back-ends -- the new objectgenerator module
      is fairly well isolated from the rest of the system, and
      encompasses most of the dependencies on the mxTextTools engine. Adding
      an optional Earley or similar back-end should be
      possible with minimal upset to the project. &nbsp;A backend using re
      objects is another possibility (my precursor mcf.pars engine was
      written to use regexen for parsing, and was an acceptable (though
      not stellar) performer).</li>
    <li>Alternative EBNF grammars -- SimpleParse's EBNF, though fairly
      readily understood, is not by any means the only EBNF variant,
      providing support for a number of EBNF variants would ease the job
      of porting grammars to the system.</li>
    <li>More common/library code -- common data formats, HTML and/or
      SGML parsers</li>
  </ul>
  <p> mxTextTools Rewrite Enhancements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Case-insensitive matching commands? </li>
    <li>Backtracking support?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Alternate C Back-end?<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Given the amount of effort poured into the mxTextTools engine,
      this may seem silly, but it would be nice to implement a more advanced
      parsing algorithm directly in C, without going through the
      assembly-like
      interface of mxTextTools. &nbsp;Given that Marc-André isn't
      interested
      in adopting the non-recursive codebase, there's not much point
      retaining compatability with mxTextTools, so moving to a more
      parser-friendly engine might be the best approach.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>mxBase/mxTextTools Installation<br>
  </h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> This section only
    applies to SimpleParse versions before 2.1.0, SimpleParse 2.1.0 and
    above include a patched version of mxTextTools already!</p>
  <p>You will want an mxBase
    2.1.0 distribution to run SimpleParse, preferably with the
    non-recursive rewrite. If you want to use
    the non-recursive implementation, you will need to get the source
    archive for mxTextTools. &nbsp;It is possible to use mxBase 2.0.3 with
    SimpleParse,
    but not to use it for building the non-recursive TextTools engine
    (2.0.3 also lacks a lot of features and bug-fixes found in the 2.1.0
    versions).</p>
  <p>Note: without the <span style="font-weight: bold;">non-recursive
      rewrite</span> of 2.1.0 (i.e. with the recursive version), the test
    suite will not pass all tests.&nbsp;
    I'm not sure why they fail with the recursive version, but it
    does
    argue for using the non-recursive rewrite.</p>
  <p>To build the non-recursive TextTools engine, you'll need to
    get the source distribution for the non-recursive implementation from
    the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=55673">SimpleParse
      file repository</a>.&nbsp; Note,
    there are incompatabilities in the mxBase 2.1 versions that make it
    necessary to use the versions specified below to build the
    non-recursive versions.<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python 2.2.x, <a href="http://lists.egenix.com/mailman-archives/egenix-users/2002-August/000078.html">mxBase
