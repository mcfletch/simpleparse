"""Values to match result-trees even when implementations change

These values match the "logical" values of the result-trees
as they apply to SimpleParse's usage, rather than the particular
concrete results returned by the engine.  So, for instance, you
can say "returns no children" (NullResults) for result-tuples or
"whatever failure position" for failure return values.
